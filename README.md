# Learning more React

This assignment's purpose is to gain familiarity with Routing.
Loading it up should be a white page, as I haven't added the automatic redirect to /home yet

## /home
Welcome page

## /4
Displays the number "4", or any other number added to the route

## /hello
Displays the word "hello" or any other word added to the route

## /hello/blue/red
Displays the word "hello" in blue text with a red background. Works with any valid word or color
